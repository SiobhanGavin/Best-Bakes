		<h2>Tips</h2>
		<p> Here are our tips for home-baking:
		<ul class="b">
			<li class="list2">Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of meringue powder to your mix to help it rise a bit higher and make it a bit lighter in texture.</li>
			<li class="list2">Add 1 envelope of unflavored gelatin to the batter, helps prevent the surface from splitting or cracking.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Take your time creaming the butter, beat/cream for at least 5 minutes to get lots of air into the butter. Add the sugar and beat/cream really well again.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Separate eggs first, beat yolks till golden and creamy then add to the butter/sugar mixture. Beat the egg whites until light and frothy before folding them into the butter mixture.</li>
		
			<li class="list2">Chocolate: Before adding the bicarb required, mix it with a teaspoon of vinegar.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Dense or Fruit Cakes: Keep a heatproof dish full of water in the oven while baking (replace water if needed to keep it topped up).</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Measure all ingredients to exact amounts first, then sift.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Fill tins no more than 1/2 to 2/3 full to allow for even rising.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Once you've poured the batter in, wobble the pan sideways a bit so the batter reaches up along each side (with the middle being slightly lower). As it bakes the middle and edges will meet and rise more evenly.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">If it rose high and uneven in the middle, you may need to slice a bit off across the top so it's level.</li>
		
			<li class="list2">Preheat the oven first before starting, make sure the rack is in the center (unless directed differently) and keep tin in the center of the rack. If you're baking more than one at a time, keep them at least 2" away from the walls of the oven and from each other.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Using a toothpick, wood skewer or a piece of raw spaghetti, test for doneness by placing the toothpick into the middle. If it comes out clean, it's done</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Don't attempt to ice it until it's completely cool. Dust the surface lightly with a pastry brush first, helps reduce crumbs in the icing.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">First ice with a thin layer, then refrigerate (covered). After an hour you can do a complete frosting job. This helps keep the crumbs at bay and your outer frosting layer should be crumb free.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Heat a knife first before cutting for crumble-free slices. To heat the knife, you can run the knife under very hot water then wipe dry with a clean towel.</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Use unwaxed dental floss to slice (great for the gooey or sticky varieties).</li>
			
			<li class="list2">Wrap the leftover cake with a few slices of apple or cubes of sugar or a slice of fresh bread set inside the pan (or in the open space of the plate). Make sure to store it in an airtight container or wrapped well in plastic wrap.</li>
			<li class="list2">Dust the holder or platter with a bit of confectioner's sugar before placing the cake on it, this will help keep it from sticking to the bottom.</li>
			<li class="list2">Use ingredients that are at room temperature, the butter soft but not melted or oily.</li>
			<li class="list2">How To Make Bigger Cakes From Mixes: Add 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp. baking powder to the boxed mix.</li>
			</ul>
